I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the capability to browse the internet or access personal data unless it's shared with me in the course of our conversation. Since I cannot access external URLs, I can't view your GitHub profile directly.

However, I can certainly help you draft a cool README template that you can customize and use for your GitHub profile! Here's a sample template:

# Hi there, I'm Jayd 👋

## I'm a Student, Developer, and Lifelong Learner!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Project Name](Project URL)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything 🤣
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- 🥅 2024 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play guitar and go hiking.
